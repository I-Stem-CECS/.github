👋 Welcome to the GitHub page of I-Stem !
   Created in 2005 through a collaboration between Inserm (National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and AFM-Telethon (French Association against Myopathies). I-Stem ✨ is the largest French laboratory for research and development dedicated to human pluripotent stem cells, of embryonic origin or obtained by reprogramming gene.

   I-Stem is part of the Biotherapy Institute for Rare Diseases, which includes so far the three centers of research and development funded directly by the AFM Telethon.

You will be provided with the code of the different 🖥️ bioinformatics analysis projects of the research teams, in collaboration with the 👩‍🔬 [NGS platform](https://www.istem.eu/plateformes-technologiques/analyses-genomiques/).
